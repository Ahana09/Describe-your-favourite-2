            <p> Hi! My name is Ahana Shah. I live in Mumbai and I study in Dhirubhai Ambani International School, Bandra. 
                I like all the subjects of my school, but some favourite's are Math, History, Science and Hindi. I like to code, play chess, do judo, bake and cook, swim, study, etc. 
                Out of all hobbies my favourite is to code! I have made many apps on Code.org, Thunkable, CodePen.io, Visual Studio Code, etc. Come on! Let me brief you on my favourite hobby, that is CODING! </p>

            <h2> My Favourite Hobby!<br> <span id="hobby"> Coding! </span></h2>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p> Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. 
                You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things. We all have hopes, dreams, and plans for the future. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a new opportunity, want to optimize your current job, or are simply searching for a new hobby, coding can help you get closer to your goals. 
                And remember, anyone can learn how to code! I started to learn coding in July 2020. My teacher, Miss Priyanka, taught me how to code in such a fun way, that everyday, in my free time, I used to code different apps and games. 
                In coding you not only learn computer programming, but math as well! I have a blast coding! üòÑüíñüë©‚Äçüíª
